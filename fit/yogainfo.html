        <h1> WHAT IS YOGA </h1>
        <P>
            There is so much to Yoga than just acrobatic<br>
            skill or flexibility. <br>
            Yoga is an ancient practice originating from<BR>
            the Sanskrit language of ancient India which <br>
            has a Hindu religion practice and rituals. <br>
            Moreover, the word Yoga has three interpretations<br>
            which depicts what this exercise is really about;<br>
            union, concentration and control. <br>
            These three go harmoniously to ensure that you<br>
            get the best results in Yoga. <br>
            More importantly, if one of these are not done well,<br>
            the individual cannot fully do Yoga effectively.<br>
