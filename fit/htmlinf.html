        <h1>GYM BENIFITS </h1>
        <P><b><u>1. Improved health</u></b><br>

            Let’s start with the obvious.<br>
            When you regularly attend a gym <br>
            and are smashing<br>
            the cardio and weights, <br>
            you’re definitely going to see<br>
            an improvement<br>
            in your overall health and wellbeing.<br></P>

        <h1>2. Equipment and expert knowledge</h1>

        <p>Most gyms are going to be full of everything you’ll<br>
            ever need for your workouts. From rowing machines<br>
            to saunas, treadmills to free weights, whatever <br>
            fitness goals you want to achieve you’ll find the<br>
            equipment to get you there at the gym.<br>
            Additionally, there should always be a qualified instructor<br>
            in your gym to help you use the machines and exercise correctly.<br>
            Priceless when you’re just starting out.<br>
            Regardless of the equipment and space you have at home,<br>
            you’re going to struggle to compete with the resources and<br>
            expertise of any gym.</p>

        <h1> 3. Classes & community</h1>
        <p> Then, of course, there are the classes and a community<br>
            of people all with the same intentions<br>
            as you. Getting fit.<br>
            Spinning, Yoga, Crossfit, you name it…<br>
            Most gyms offer loads of classes these days<br>
            at different<br>
            times of the day to suit your needs. They can be hugely<br>
            motivating and help you move closer to <br>
            your health goals<br>
            more quickly.<br>
            As adults with jobs and kids, it’s often difficult to expand<br>
            our social circle outside of the usual places; work, school,<br>
            the local pub.<br>
            However, hitting the gym regularly will<br>
            allow you to make<br>
            friends with a variety of different people with similar <br>
            health goals to you. Having friends to meet and work out<br>
            with can be one of the most motivating factors in reaching<br>
            your health goals.<br>
        </p>

    4. Increased energy levels
    Fact. Exercise increases energy levels and helps you feel more alert.
    If you often feel tired throughout the day and can only dream of having the energy levels of a 5-year-old, then I’ve
    got news for you.
    Only by running and skipping around like a 5-year-old will you feel like one! (Catch22).
    Yep, all that huffing and puffing as you workout in the gym is going to improve your lung capacity, which will allow
    for much more oxygen to be pumped into your brain and bloodstream helping you feel more alert and ready for action
    (or like a 5-year-old).
    In addition, regular exercise helps your blood to circulate oxygen to your muscles more efficiently giving you a
    heightened level of energy production.

    8. Improved physique and posture
    It goes without saying really, but regular exercise and strength training will (eventually) change your body shape,
    help you lose weight (when combined with a healthy diet – see point 12), and improve your posture.
    If like most middle-aged men, you sit and work at a desk all day, then you’re probably going to suffer from upper
    and lower back pain at some point, as well as rounded shoulders (upper crossed syndrome) too.
    For me, this is one of the biggest benefits of joining a gym and getting fit and strong in my forties. If I don’t
    fix my hideous posture and physique now, it’s only going to get worse and cause me more problems in the future.

    9. Motivation & commitment
    While working out at home has its benefits, it can also spell disaster for your motivation and commitment to getting
    your routine done.
    With a million distractions and the kids around your ankles, excuses like “I’ll work out when the kids are in bed”
    or “I’ll do it after dinner” will most of the time turn into “I’ll do it tomorrow.” Which of course, never comes.
    Without real focus and a solid routine to follow, your motivation and commitment to really getting fit and strong
    are going to be in jeopardy from day one.
    Hitting the gym a few times a week, with no other distractions, and really committing to that program will not only
    help to keep you on track but keep you firmly motivated and committed to the cause.
