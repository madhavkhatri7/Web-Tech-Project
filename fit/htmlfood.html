        <h1>HEALTHY DIET</h1>
        <P>
            A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition<br> in all its forms, as well as noncommunicable
            diseases (NCDs),<br>including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.<br>Unhealthy diet and lack of
            physical activity are leading<br>global risks to health.<br>Healthy dietary practices start early in life –
            breastfeeding<br>fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development, and<br>may have longer term
            health benefits such as reducing the risk<br>of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in
            life.<br>

        <p>Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans)<br>,
            nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet,<br>
            oats, wheat and brown rice).<br>
            At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) <br>
            of fruit and vegetables
            per day (2), excluding potatoes,<br>
            sweet potatoes,<br>
            cassava and other starchy roots.<br>
            Less than 10% of total energy intake from<br>
            free sugars (2, 7),which is equivalent<br>
            to 50 g (or about 12 level teaspoons)<br>
            for a person of healthy body weight consuming about <br>
            2000 calories per day, but ideally is less than 5% of total<br>
            energy intake for additional health benefits (7). Free sugars <br>
            are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer,<br>

            HEALTHY INFANTS
        </h1>
        <p>
            n the first 2 years of a child’s life, optimal nutrition <br>
            fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development.<br>
            It also reduces the risk of becoming overweight or obese<br>
            and developing NCDs later in life.<br>
            Advice on a healthy diet for infants and children is similar<br>
            to that for adults, but the following elements are also important:<br>
            Infants should be breastfed exclusively during the first 6 months<br>
            of life.Infants should be breastfed continuously until 2 years of <br>
            age and beyond.From 6 months of age, breast milk should be complemented<br>
            with a variety of adequate, safe and nutrient-dense foods.<br>
            Salt and sugars should not be added to complementary foods.<br>
